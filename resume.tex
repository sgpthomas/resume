%\setlength{\makecvtitlenamewidth}{10cm}           % for the 'classic' style, if you want to force the width allocated to your name and avoid line breaks. be careful though, the length is normally calculated to avoid any overlap with your personal info; use this at your own typographical risks...

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Lead the FuTIL project, a novel intermediate language and infrastructure
    that separates the structure of a program from the control of the program to enable more
    simple construction of software-hardware compilers. \url{https://github.com/cucapra/futil}.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item First author on paper submitted to ASPLOS 2021.
    \item Developed working infrastructure that generate synthesizable RTL.
    \item Organize a team of six people.
      \item Work closely with undergraduate researchers to help introduce them
        to Computer Science research.
    \end{itemize}
    % \item Develop a prototype interpreter for FuTIL, a novel intermediate
    %   language that separates the structure of a computation from the control to
    %   make high level synthesis easier. \url{https://github.com/cucapra/futil}
    % \item Working with Adrian Sampson on FuTIL, an intermediate language for
    %   hardware compilation.
  \item Worked on Dahlia, a programming language that uses affine types to model
    hardware resources.
